# Akabusk

Movie info displayer.

Requirements:
1. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
2. [Node](https://nodejs.org)

## Building

To preview the project, you need to do three things:
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run serve`
3. open [127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000/) in the browser

## Development

What you want is to basically have two terminals:
1. `npm run serve` -- this is providing the [127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000/) "server" and watching changes on Jekyll
2. `npm run watch` -- this is watching all source files and producing dist ones

## TODO

Mandatory:
    - movieDetailsModule
    - some global styles for whole app?
    - movieDetails styles
    - styles for searchBox
    - styles for searchResults
    - add LOAD MORE RESULTS button to searchResultsCtrl for when there are more pages of results from API

Improvements:
    - write smart tests for httpRetrierModule
    - errorNotifier module?
